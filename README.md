# Police Shootings Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of fatal police shootings in the United States since January 1, 2015, sourced from The Washington Post. The dataset is comprehensive, covering various details such as demographics, circumstances, and additional factors related to each incident. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and predictive modeling to derive insights and build models for key outcomes.

## Key Features
* Data Analysis and Visualization:

Explored and visualized the dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract meaningful insights.
Studied demographics, circumstances, and trends surrounding police shootings.

* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Ensured data integrity through thorough cleaning, addressing missing values, and managing outliers.
Engineered features and applied normalization techniques to prepare the data for predictive modeling.

* Predictive Modeling:

Implemented machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network.  
Predicted key outcomes such as signs of mental illness and race, utilizing label encoding and oversampling techniques for improved model performance.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest model to enhance accuracy.
